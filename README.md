# nannou playground
Playground for experimenting with [nannou](https://nannou.cc).

## How to run
You need a working [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) installation, then simply do `cargo run --release --bin <bin_name>` where bin name is the name of a file in `src/bin/`. For example: `cargo run --release --bin flowfield`.
